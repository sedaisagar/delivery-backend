- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based auth with role management
- **Business Logic Layer**: Delivery management, statistics, routing
- **Data Access Layer**: ORM with optimized queries

## 2. Database Schema & ERD

### Core Entities

**User Management**
```
User (Custom Model)
├── id (Primary Key)
├── email (Unique)
├── username
├── first_name, last_name
├── phone
├── role (driver/admin/customer)
├── avatar
├── created_at, updated_at
└── is_active, is_staff
```

**Delivery System**
```
DeliveryRequest
├── id (Primary Key)
├── pickup_address, dropoff_address
├── customer_name, customer_phone
├── delivery_note
├── status (pending/assigned/in_progress/completed/cancelled)
├── sync_status (synced/pending/failed)
├── pending_sync (Boolean)
├── coordinates (pickup/dropoff lat/lng)
├── customer (FK → User)
├── driver (FK → User, nullable)
├── assigned_by (FK → User, nullable)
├── created_at, updated_at
├── synced_at, assigned_at
└── timestamps
```

**Supporting Entities**
```
Route
├── delivery_request (OneToOne → DeliveryRequest)
├── distance, duration
├── polyline (encoded route)
├── mode (driving/walking/bicycling)
└── created_at

Statistics
├── user (FK → User)
├── date
├── total_deliveries, completed_deliveries
├── pending_deliveries, in_progress_deliveries
├── total_distance, total_earnings
├── average_rating, on_time_delivery_rate
└── unique_together (user, date)

SyncLog
├── delivery_request (FK → DeliveryRequest)
├── status (success/failed)
├── message
└── created_at
```

### Relationships
- **User → DeliveryRequest**: One-to-Many (customer creates requests)
- **User → DeliveryRequest**: One-to-Many (driver assigned to requests)
- **DeliveryRequest → Route**: One-to-One (each request has one route)
- **DeliveryRequest → SyncLog**: One-to-Many (sync history)
- **User → Statistics**: One-to-Many (daily stats per user)

## 3. Authentication & Role-Based Permission Strategy

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: Email-based registration with role selection
2. **Login**: JWT token generation with role information
3. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token renewal
4. **Logout**: Token blacklisting

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Customer Role**
- **Permissions**: Create delivery requests, view own requests, update profile
- **Data Access**: Only own delivery requests and statistics
- **API Endpoints**: `/delivery-requests/`, `/statistics/customer/`

**Driver Role**
- **Permissions**: View assigned deliveries, update delivery status, view statistics
- **Data Access**: Assigned delivery requests, driver-specific statistics
- **API Endpoints**: `/delivery-requests/assigned/`, `/statistics/driver/`

**Admin Role**
- **Permissions**: Full system access, assign drivers, view all data
- **Data Access**: All delivery requests, user management, system statistics
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints, debug endpoints

### Permission Implementation
- **Custom Permission Classes**: `IsCustomer`, `IsDriver`, `IsAdmin`
- **Object-Level Security**: `IsOwnerOrAdmin` for data ownership
- **Method-Level Security**: Role-specific endpoint access
- **Mobile App Protection**: `MobileAppPermission` blocks admin access to mobile endpoints

## 4. Offline Sync Handling Logic

### Offline-First Architecture
The system follows an offline-first approach where the mobile app can function without internet connectivity.

### Sync Strategy

**Data Flow**
```
Mobile App (Offline) → Local Storage → Sync Queue → API → Database
```

**Sync Components**
1. **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage for offline data persistence
2. **Sync Queue**: Pending operations stored locally
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Timestamp-based conflict detection
4. **Incremental Sync**: Only changed data transmitted
5. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed syncs

### Sync Process
1. **Create Request (Offline)**
   - Store in local database with `pending_sync: true`
   - Generate local ID for reference
   - Queue for sync when online

2. **Sync to Server**
   - Send pending requests to `/sync/pending/`
   - Server validates and creates records
   - Returns mapping of local IDs to server IDs

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Server checks for duplicate requests
   - Uses timestamp and user data for conflict detection
   - Returns conflicts for user resolution

4. **Status Updates**
   - Real-time updates via push notifications
   - Background sync for status changes
   - Local cache invalidation on sync

### Sync Endpoints
- **POST `/sync/pending/`**: Upload offline requests
- **GET `/sync/status/`**: Check sync status and pending count
- **Response Format**: Success/failed/conflicts with detailed mapping

## 5. Scaling Considerations

### Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization**
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized ORM queries with select_related/prefetch_related
- **Pagination**: Configurable page sizes (max 10 items) to reduce load
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data (user sessions, statistics)

**API Optimization**
- **Response Compression**: Gzip compression for API responses
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination to handle large datasets
- **Filtering**: Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Scalability Strategies

**Horizontal Scaling**
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple Django instances behind a load balancer
- **Database Sharding**: User-based sharding for large datasets
- **CDN**: Static file delivery via CDN
- **Microservices**: Potential split into auth, delivery, and notification services

**Background Processing**
- **Celery**: Async task processing for:
  - Email notifications
  - Push notifications
  - Statistics calculation
  - Route optimization
- **Redis**: Message broker and caching layer
- **Task Queues**: Priority queues for critical operations

**Monitoring & Observability**
- **Application Monitoring**: Performance metrics and error tracking
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance and connection pooling
- **API Analytics**: Usage patterns and endpoint performance
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging for debugging

### Load Handling

**Traffic Management**
- **API Versioning**: Backward compatibility with versioned endpoints
- **Graceful Degradation**: Essential features work during high load
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Auto-scaling**: Cloud-based auto-scaling based on metrics

**Data Management**
- **Data Archiving**: Old delivery data moved to cold storage
- **Statistics Aggregation**: Pre-calculated statistics for performance
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups with point-in-time recovery

## 6. Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration

**Development Environment**
- **Local Development**: Django development server with SQLite
- **Testing**: pytest with test database
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, flake8 linting

**Staging Environment**
- **Production-like**: PostgreSQL, Redis, proper environment variables
- **Testing**: Integration tests and load testing
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring and alerting

**Production Environment**
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Compose for container management
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for session and cache management

### CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration**
1. **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting checks
2. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and API tests
3. **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. **Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation

**Continuous Deployment**
1. **Build**: Docker image creation with multi-stage builds
2. **Test**: Automated testing in staging environment
3. **Deploy**: Blue-green deployment to production
4. **Monitor**: Health checks and rollback procedures

### Infrastructure

**Cloud Architecture**
- **Compute**: Containerized Django applications
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for session and data caching
- **Storage**: Object storage for media files
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for static assets

**Security Measures**
- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with audit logging

This technical design provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable delivery management system that can handle both online and offline operations effectively.
